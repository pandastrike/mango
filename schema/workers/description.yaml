  environments:
    description:
      An environment is a collection of Cloud resources that are allocated
      on your behalf to deploy the worker.
      For example, perhaps you wish to test changes at a secondary hostname
      without disrupting production deployments. Organizing configuration
      for those two cases into separate environments allows you to publish
      from the commandline by just invoking the name, not adjusting
      configuration each time.

      environments is a dictionary. The keys are the name of the given
      environment, and its value is the definition.
