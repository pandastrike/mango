          An environment is a collection of Cloud resources that are allocated
          on your behalf as a distinct serverless Sky deployment.
          For example, perhaps you wish to test changes at a secondary hostname
          without disrupting production deployments. Organizing configuration
          for those two cases into separate environments allows you to publish
          from the commandline by just invoking the name, not adjusting
          configuration each time.

          environments is a dictionary. The keys are the name of the given
          environment, and its value is the definition.
