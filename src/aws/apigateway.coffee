# TODO - I implemented this during an afternoon that I thought I needed it, but
#   it turns out I don't.  So, I'll go ahead and leave this code in place, but
#   is orphaned as of this writing.  It may be handy once we start using the
#   custom domain resources and caching under the Gateway umbrella.
